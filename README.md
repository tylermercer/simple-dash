# SimpleDash

This was a tiny thrown-together project to build my own new tab page for Brave for Android. Unfortunately, I found that having to click the Home button each time I opened a new tab (since you can't customize the New Tab page directly) was too unwieldy, and the allure of having a thing I could pour endless hours of pointless polish into right in front of my face every time I used my phone browser was too distracting. So, like with [Logwise](https://github.com/tylermercer/logwise), I've [unlaunched](https://tylermercer.net/posts/software/unlaunching/) this and won't be using it anymore.
